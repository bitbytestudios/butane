///
/// # Overview
///
/// Entity managers create, destroy, and track entities. They also facilitate
/// high-level management of entities through a few simple but powerful
/// mechanisms.
///
/// \remark Since entities don't "exist" per se and rather are an abstraction
/// around weak references referring to entities, you can conceptualize this as
/// an index.
///
/// ## Naming
///
/// Entities can be _uniquely_ named and looked up by name in constant time.
/// However, you cannot look up the name of a particular entity. This is a
/// consequence of names being hashed to reduce memory footprint and improve
/// performance.
///
/// ## Hierarchy
///
/// Entities can be and often are linked to each other to form a logical
/// hierarchy. This is distinct from the physical hierarchy described by the
/// [`TransformSystem`](@ref yeti::TransformSystem) as the this hierarchy
/// controls how entities are managed. Specifically, whenever an entity is
/// destroyed so are its logical children. Put another way, the logical
/// hierarchy describes the logical composition of the world rather than its
/// physical manifestation (although there is often overlap.)
///
/// \remark This is employed heavily by entities, prefabs, and levels. For
/// example, levels are the logical parents of every entity contained in them,
/// that way all entities are destroyed when the level is unloaded.
///
/// ## Lifetime
///
/// As entities are essentially weak references, validity can be quickly
/// checked through `alive` and `dead`.
///
/// ## Ownership
///
/// One or more entities may be associated with an arbitary non-zero 32-bit
/// integer referred to as a "cookie." At any point, various operations can be
/// performed on any entities associated with a particular cookie. This can be
/// used establish weak ownership semantics of entities.
///
/// \remark Cookies shouldn't be used to tag entities as a certain type to
/// drive game logic. Rather, the [`TagSystem`](@ref yeti::TagSystem) should
/// be used. For example, each spawn point could be tagged as such and iterated
/// on load to build internal data structures necessary for spawning or
/// respawning players or enemies.
///
/// ### Garbage Collection
///
/// Rather than relying on callbacks, you can periodically check if entities
/// are alive to perform "garbage collection" of data associated with a
/// particular entity.
///
/// \warning As liveliness is implemented by counting underlying reuse of slots
/// there is a very small possibility of erroneously considering an entity
/// alive when it is actually dead. Good practice is to check relatively
/// frequently to prevent that from happening.
///
/// ## Callbacks
///
/// You can dynamically register and unregister callbacks that are called
/// whenever an entity is created or destroyed.
///
